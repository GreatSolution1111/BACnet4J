*Version 2.0 release notes*

The networking package of this product has been pretty much entirely rewritten to support MS/TP. These changes implied
many changes to the LocalDevice public interface, so if you were using version 1.x you will need to port some code to
upgrade.

Commercial licensers can pay an upgrade fee to use this new version (2.x) commercially.
